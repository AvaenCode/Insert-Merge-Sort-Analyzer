# Insert Sort & Merge Sort Analyzer

The following C++ program will allow the user to compare the performance of both the Insert Sort and Merge Sort algorithms on 3 different sets of integers. The 3 different sets are constructed as so:
- Array of size 'n' in ascending order.
- Array of size 'n' in descending order.
- Array of size 'n' in random order.

The application will be running through the console.

Note: By default, the size 'n' of the 3 arrays will be 100. That can be adjusted in the Main.cpp file of the project.
